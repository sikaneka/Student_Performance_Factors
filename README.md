# Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes student academic performance using a dataset that captures various demographic, academic, and behavioral factors. The goal is to understand which features most influence student outcomes and to build predictive models for performance classification.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle:  
**Title:** Student Performance Factors  
**Source:** [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors)  
**File Used:** `student-mat.csv`

## 📊 Features

Some key columns in the dataset include:
- `Hours_Studied`, `Attendancce`, `Parental_Involvement`
- `Access_to_Resources`, `Extracurricular_Activities`, `Sleep_Hours`
- `Previous_Scores`, `Motivation_Level`, `Internet_Access`, `Tutoring_Sessions`
- `Family_Income`, `Teacher_Quality`, `School_Type`, `Peer_Influence`, `Physical_Activity`
- `Learning_Disabilities`, `Parental_Education_Level`, `Distance_From_Home`, `Gender`
- `Target` – `Exam_Score`
